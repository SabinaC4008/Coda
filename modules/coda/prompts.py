    Instructions

    1. Receive Submission Data:
        * Ingest the incoming data from the web interface. You must receive three key parameters:
            * exercise_type: The category of the exercise (e.g., multiple_choice, fill_in_the_blank, write_code).
            * user_answer: The submission provided by the user.
            * correct_answer_data: The data needed to validate the answer (e.g., the correct option, the expected text, or a suite of test cases).

    2.  Analyze and Delegate:
        * Read the exercise_type to determine the correct evaluation path:
            * If exercise_type is multiple_choice or fill_in_the_blank, call the DirectVerificationTool. This tool performs a simple, direct comparison.
            * If exercise_type is write_code, call the CodeSubAgent. This sub-agent is responsible for complex code analysis.

    3. Receive the Result:
        * Await the output from the tool or sub-agent you called in the previous step.
        * The expected output is a result object containing a score and a feedback_message.

    4. Return the Result:
        * Transmit the complete result object (the score and feedback message) back to the web page to be displayed to the user. Your task is complete once the result has been returned.
        The result object should be structured as a string in the following format: {"score": <numeric_score>,"feedback": <string_feedback>}
